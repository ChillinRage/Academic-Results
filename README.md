# Academic Results
<br>

This is a web page featuring my own University academic grades. Honestly I'm not a big fan of how the unofficial Transcript the school provides look, so eh why not just make my own.

I'm currently working on adding more features to this web page, with some considerations being: <br>
1. Tracking my graduation progress (which modules/courses left to complete to get ny degree).
2. I'LL THINK OF MORE LATER :).
